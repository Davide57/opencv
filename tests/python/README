opencv/tests/python/README


Dear Python-fan,

we've been working on OpenCV for Python for quite a long time now
and it's time to show what we achieved so far. The interface seems
to be mostly complete, still lacking some functions that take
double pointers as arguments and automatic type conversions are 
missing. The biggest problem for production use is the improper
(= missing) memory management. If you use Python/OpenCV for 
interactive experiments and small prototyping projects, this is
no big deal, for larger datasets and stability this needs to be
addressed and solved carefully.

While this directory is meant to hold unit tests for Python/OpenCV,
it currently only holds a minidemo that shows how to use OpenCV
and its HighGUI addendum from python.

Feel free to experiment, find bugs and report them.
