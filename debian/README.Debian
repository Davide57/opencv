Notes for the Debian OpenCV packages:

 To compile code against OpenCV, use `pkg-config --cflags opencv`:

   gcc `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -c code.c -o code.o

 To link it afterwards, use `pkg-config --libs opencv`:

   gcc code.o -o code `pkg-config --libs opencv` -lotherlibs

 There is currently no way to exclude libcvaux or libhighgui from the
link process. I will talk with upstream about this.
